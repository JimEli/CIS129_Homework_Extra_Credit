## Loops and Arrays (Extra Credit Lab)

This program reads 5 series of numbers input by the user. Each series is terminated with a negative number. There is no limit placed on the amount of numbers per series (it's only limited by heap size). The 5 series of numbers are then totaled and the maximum sum is identified. The program displays the maximum sum along with the addends which make up that series. 

* The program uses the Collection, ArrayList, Generics and Lambdas/Streams features of Java.
 
*Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of PCC CIS-219.*
